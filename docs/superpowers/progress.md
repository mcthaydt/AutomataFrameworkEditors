# Progress

The tracker every stage reads first and updates last. One section per cycle; newest first.

## Cycle 1: the 2D first layer, the Editors' share of M1

Spec: [`2026-11-13-2d-first-layer-design.md`](https://github.com/mcthaydt/AutomataFramework/blob/main/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-13-2d-first-layer-design.md)
in the AutomataFramework repo (milestone M1, the Editors line).

Overall: **8%** (stage 1 is the shared spec and counts 4 points, stage 2 is 4, stage 3 is 4, stage 4 is 60, stage 5
is 10, stage 6 is 12, stage 7 is 6)

| Stage | State | Output |

| 2. Plan | Done, in review | [`plans/2026-11-13-m1-thin-thread-editors.md`](plans/2026-11-13-m1-thin-thread-editors.md) |

### Waiting on the Owner

No question is open. The accounts the real iPad check needs (Cloudflare, the GitHub App) are in the
plan's "Before starting".

### Log

- 2026-11-13: Stage 2, added to after the first plan merged. The Owner: agents working on the code are the primary
  way a game is made, and the editors change authorable content only (the JSON files); anyone can use the editor
  freely without signing in and keep a copy, and saving or working with others needs a sign-in. The plan is now 21
  tasks: the API lets a visitor read a public game, the page asks for sign-in only when it is needed, and a new
  Task 18 adds "Try it now", "Keep a copy" and the visitor's journeys. The plan audit reads this version.
- 2026-11-13: Stage 2. The Editors' M1 plan written: 20 tasks. The Owner's decisions the same day widened M1 for this
  repo: the editors are for teams; every access level (Look, Suggest, Approve, Edit, Owner) with a Share screen;
  the editor's own GitHub App does the GitHub work through an API on Cloudflare Pages Functions, so people need
  GitHub only to sign in; levels live in `automata.access.toml` in the game's repo; onboarding is its own task.
  This pull request also adds `CLAUDE.md` and this tracker. The framework is pinned to `ec4fddd` (the commit that
  added its `prepare` script). Nothing is published to npm in M1. Not checked: the GitHub calls are written from
  memory, because the planning session's network refused GitHub's documentation; the plan audit should check them.
